# Stochastic Differential Equations for Financial Time Series  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explores the application of **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)** to model stock price dynamics and volatility in financial markets. Both **classical SDEs** (Geometric Brownian Motion, Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck, Heston) and **Neural SDEs** are implemented and benchmarked against traditional econometric models such as **GARCH/ARCH**.  

The goal is to evaluate the ability of SDE-based models to capture the statistical properties of high-frequency intraday NSE data, generate realistic synthetic trajectories, and improve forecasting accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Classical SDE Implementations**  
  - Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  
  - Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) Process  
  - Heston Stochastic Volatility Model  
- **Parameter Estimation**  
  - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)  
  - Kalman Filtering for latent volatility states  
- **Simulation**  
  - Monte Carlo (~100k trajectories) with Eulerâ€“Maruyama & Milstein schemes  
  - Validation of synthetic paths against empirical moments  
- **Neural SDEs (via `torchsde`)**  
  - Learned dynamics from data  
  - ~18% improvement in log-likelihood over classical SDEs  
  - Outperformed GARCH/ARCH benchmarks on intraday returns  
- **Robust Validation**  
  - Distributional consistency checks  
  - Backtesting with realized volatility measures
